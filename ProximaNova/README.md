Here's the mapping (which is also valid CSS):

```
@include fontFace('Proxima Nova', 600, normal, '~assets/fonts/ProximaNova/351C86_1_0.eot', ('eot'));
@include fontFace('Proxima Nova', 600, normal, '~assets/fonts/ProximaNova/351C86_1_0.ttf', ('truetype'));
@include fontFace('Proxima Nova', 600, normal, '~assets/fonts/ProximaNova/351C86_1_0.woff', ('woff'));
@include fontFace('Proxima Nova', 600, normal, '~assets/fonts/ProximaNova/351C86_1_0.woff2', ('woff2'));

@include fontFace('Proxima Nova', 700, normal, '~assets/fonts/ProximaNova/351C86_2_0.eot', ('eot'));
@include fontFace('Proxima Nova', 700, normal, '~assets/fonts/ProximaNova/351C86_2_0.ttf', ('truetype'));
@include fontFace('Proxima Nova', 700, normal, '~assets/fonts/ProximaNova/351C86_2_0.woff', ('woff'));
@include fontFace('Proxima Nova', 700, normal, '~assets/fonts/ProximaNova/351C86_2_0.woff2', ('woff2'));
```
